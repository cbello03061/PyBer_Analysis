# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The objective of this project is to create a database of trips made by type of city so that the information provided by this investigation allows strategic people to make the best decision.
For easy decision making, a graph of lines will be made that shows the total sum of rates by type of city in relation to a time line based on months.

## Results:

Through the analysis of the data analyzed from 2019 and with the graphs obtained, the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and passengers, as well as the percentage of total fares, should be shown, helping to improve access to travel services. shared and determine an area of opportunity and integrate neighborhoods without attention.

We can see by the differents type of charts, we can see clearly the information, in the next images you can see the information.

In this type of graph we can see a complete picture of the data of shared trips and it can sensitize us by giving us a complete picture (Image 1)

With the following graph you can review the ride count data, providing us with a complete overview that allows us to analyze the areas of opportunity that we have by type of city.(image 2)

The bottom graph shows in a clear and schematic way the total percentage of rides by type of city, where we can see that 68.4% of these rides are in urban city, while rural areas barely reach 5.3%.

Using this foot graph, it can be seen that the total rate percentage by type of city is similar to the previous graph, so it can be deduced that although there is a slight increase in rural cities, they maintain a certain proportion that does not trigger the data it yields. our investigation.

## Summary:

The result of the analysis carried out for the challenge, we can deduce the following:

- Total Fare Urban city
  As the graph shows us, the highest fares are in this type of shared trips, in a time line it can be deduced that in the first quarter, it is in at the end of february and March begining it is where the highest fares are reached and at the beginning of January a decrease is appreciated in the cost of the fee. 
  In January it's time to think about a loyalty promotion, perhaps providing users with a card that allows them, after a certain number of trips, to give them a free trip or a discount for their next trip. 

- Total Fare Suburban city
  This type of city has a fare peak at the end of February, but it is the highest peak of the four-month period, so it can be encouraged with some promotions during periods when costs drop and take advantage of the fact that through a high volume of trips you can get a better result.

  - Total Fare Rural city
    This type of city the highest peak is beginning April where it reaches the rate of 500, I think that due to the type of city and the geolocation there should be an event that helps increase trips and therefore the rates, for this type of city, I think that a recommendation would be to analyze what other events can be promoted that attract or motivate the user to have more rides and with the increase in demand, fares increase.
